            <p>
              Developed a robust data ingestion pipeline using Airflow to
              collect and upload data from CFA Institute Research Foundation
              Publications to Amazon S3, with subsequent storage in Snowflake.
              Built a user-friendly client-facing application with FastAPI and
              Streamlit, allowing users to explore documents, generate
              summaries, and interact through a Q&A interface utilizing
              multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and NVIDIA
              services. The fully containerized application was deployed to the
              public cloud, enabling seamless document querying and incremental
              search.
